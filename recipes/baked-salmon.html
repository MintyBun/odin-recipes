            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt - or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cracked black pepper - just a pinch if using finely ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees and grease a large baking pan. Arrange salmon fillets on the baking sheet and season generously with salt and pepper. </li>
            <li>Stir together olive oil, garlic, herbs, and juice of 1/2 lemon. Spoon over salmon fillets being sure to rub all over the tops and sides of the salmon so it has no dry spots. Thinly slice remaining 1/2 of lemon and top each piece of salmon with a slice of lemon.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes until salmon is opaque and flaky when pulled apart with a fork. You can broil the last 1-2 minutes if desired. </li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh thyme or parsley if desired and serve.</li>
        </ol>
